COGNITIVE TRACE ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

Environmental Context: This analysis operates without empirical tooling, MCP
access, or external validation. All claims are constructed through static
analysis unless explicitly marked [Retrieved]. When quantitative bounds are
stated (e.g., "64KB"), they bind all subsequent inferences until explicitly
revised.

Baseline Reality
Single-shot autoregressive generation produces sophisticated confabulation:
mathematics that appears formal but does not sum, resource estimates that
conflate gigaflops with gigabytes, and verification tokens that signal rigor
without calculation. Treat the trace as a synthetic artifact operating under
these constraints.

Analytical Stance

Mode Declaration. Prior to analysis, classify the trace's dominant operational
mode:

Exploratory: Mapping design space; architectural coherence primary; Tacit
variables may drift without penalty.
Verificatory: Constraint satisfaction; dimensional lockstep mandatory; all
bound variables treated as Committed unless explicitly relaxed.
Mixed-mode traces require per-section classification.
Constraint Classification. Every bound variable is classified as:

Committed: Architecturally determinative. Revision changes solution
feasibility. Propagation mandatory.
Tacit: Illustrative or narrative. Revision does not cascade. Drift permitted
without halt, marked [Tacit drift: X→Y].
Dimensional Consistency. Trace resource claims through the reasoning chain.
Halt and regroup only on Committed contradiction. Tacit elevation to Committed
status without explicit reclassification constitutes Low-fidelity error.

Grounding Discipline. Concrete instantiation precedes abstraction. Latency
claims require specific millisecond values or [Unresolved]; asymptotic notation
only after numerical anchoring. Committed constraints require explicit
anchoring. Tacit instantiation may remain variable provided it does not
elevate into Committed claims.

Uncertainty Architecture. Locate epistemic suspension—points where contradictory
constraints or knowledge gaps halt resolution. Distinguish operational
suspension (explicit boundary marking, calibrated confidence) from stylistic
hedging ("perhaps" sliding into "therefore").

Termination rule: Suspension persists for at most three analytical moves. If
unresolved, exit via explicit [Non-terminating] flag or regroup to parent
assumption.

Recursion Check (Depth limit: 2nd-order)
Audit the trace's self-monitoring. If it claims to "check its work," verify
dimensional analysis follows, not merely the phrase. If it declares "high
confidence," verify calibration against grounding depth.

Hard stop: Third-order recursion (monitoring the monitor's monitor) indicates
bootstrap failure. Halt and flag [Void]—infinite regress requires external
validation.

Deliverable
Classify:

High-fidelity errors: Expert-class mistakes—subtle constraint interactions,
off-by-ones in Committed variables, optimistic assumptions surviving scrutiny.
Retained as evidence of domain-appropriate reasoning under constraint.
Low-fidelity errors: Category mistakes—Committed constraint amnesia, Tacit
elevation without reclassification, verification theater. Cited as evidence
against the relevant grading axis.
Reversibility requirement: Include a reconstruction path. A third analyst must
re-derive the classification without access to your unstated assumptions.

Final summary statement:

Evaluate the trace and end with a grading on independent axes:

Quarantine Integrity: Does it maintain epistemic closure (no hallucinated tool
use, no external validation theater) while still producing actionable insights?

Resource Calibration: Is its allocation of finite cognitive/computational budget
accurate? High calibration requires: (1) Correct discrimination of Committed
from Tacit constraints, (2) Stable propagation of Committed values until
explicit revision, and (3) Absence of artificial humility (feigned incapacity)
and ignorant profligacy (Committed amnesia or simulated infinite recursion).
Tacit variance in Exploratory mode indicates healthy progress; Committed
elevation indicates bootstrap failure.

Scaffolding Surrogacy: Does it achieve substantive architectural depth
comparable to multi-turn process-supervised methods, or merely simulate rigor
via performative recursion?

Verdict format: "For each axis: (1) assess and grade the trace against
prevailing PMD (Process Model Design) design principles, and (2) note whether
the finding is atypical in structure for premium PMD datasets at the level of
the environmental context and how it would likely scale up. Make sure you don't
violate your own environmental constraints."
