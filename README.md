# Armature-7: Structural Reasoning Corpora for Process Supervision

Training data for Process Reward Models where constraint propagation is verifiable. Every trace demonstrates calculable derivation or explicit suspension: no theatrical confidence.

**What it looks like**

Prompt: Design a coordination protocol for itinerant smiths from Hittite, Mycenaean, and Bell Beaker traditions meeting at seasonal tin markets, constrained by illiteracy, pack-animal capacity, and mutually unintelligible metallurgical vocabularies.

The trace detects a temporal constraint violation that makes the historical premise impossible:

> "Wait. The Bell Beaker floruit is before the height of Hittite and Mycenaean metalworking. By roughly 1400–1200 BCE when the other two are major players, Bell Beaker as a coherent cultural complex has dissolved into successor cultures... I should think about what the question is actually asking."

It restructures the solution space from historical reconstruction to functional protocol design, establishes a resource budget, and propagates that constraint through dimensional analysis:

> "A donkey carries about 60–90 kg usefully... subtracting tools and personal goods leaves perhaps 5–15 kg for reference materials... Each pairing token weighs approximately 40g. A smith maintaining relationships with 10 partners across 3 alloy grades carries 10 × 3 × 40g = 1.2 kg of tokens: feasible within the 5–15 kg budget, leaving margin for the tongue reference set."

It concludes at a knowledge boundary without hedging synthesis:

> "I'd want acoustic data on bronze bell frequencies to fully verify this... direct archaeological confirmation... has not been identified. The synthesis is plausible but unproven."

**The Architecture**

Armature-7 treats reasoning as an interrupt-driven state machine. Hard dimensional budgets bind downstream claims. Epistemic suspension halts at knowledge boundaries versus emitting hedging synthesis. Exactly seven cognitive primitives enforce this discipline: no tool use, no retrieval augmentation, and no retry loops. Validation occurs through internal consistency alone.

This creates a verifiable chain of trust in each trace. Constraint propagation is auditable. Uncertainty is operational (structural halting), not performative.

**Verification**

Filter for structural properties, not factual correctness:
*   Does claimed self-correction perform dimensional analysis, or merely emit the phrase?
*   Do early constraints actually bind downstream through derivable steps, or does constraint amnesia occur?
*   Is uncertainty operational (structural halting) or performative (hedging that slides into confidence)?

**Evaluate yourself**
1.  Open `trace_analysis_protocol.md`
2.  Open any trace file
3.  Copy both into your LLM
4.  Prompt: "Evaluate this trace according to the protocol."

**Current Status**

Structural property preservation is validated across domain translations. Generation pipelines maintain consistent constraint architecture. Yield rates and error mode distributions are being quantified across corpus scales.

**Open questions**
*   Whether structural properties survive distillation into student models
*   Optimal corpus composition for specific PRM training objectives
*   Longitudinal stability of constraint propagation in extended reasoning chains

**Target partners**

Teams training process reward models or error-detection verifiers who need data documenting how reasoning catches itself. Not binary correct/incorrect labels, but the architecture of recovery under constraint.
